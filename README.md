# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description

I worked super hard on this, hope the grading team doesn't kill me on my grade. This assignment was very difficult, I didn't have enough time to complete every function needed... This really challenge me and got me thinking about JavaScript. Currently right now im missing 2 features which is highscore and timer, didn't have enough time to implement those and some better styling.
